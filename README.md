## Hi there 👋

I am a PhD Researcher in AI at the University of Southampton, part of the UKRI MINDS CDT (Centre for Doctoral Training). My research explores **human pose estimation using radar sensing**—developing models that can understand human movement in challenging conditions where traditional vision systems fall short.

### 🔬 Research Interests

My work focuses on building robust AI systems for human motion understanding in **low-light, occluded, and privacy-sensitive environments**. I'm particularly interested in:
- **Radar-based Human Pose Estimation** - Leveraging mmWave radar for privacy-preserving motion capture
- **Multi-modal Sensor Fusion** - Combining radar, vision, and other sensors for robust perception
- **Deep Learning for Motion Understanding** - Developing neural architectures for temporal movement analysis
- **Real-world Assistive Applications** - Translating research into practical solutions

### 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I'm actively seeking:
- Research collaborations on human motion analysis
- Dataset exchanges for multi-modal sensing
- Industry partnerships for real-world applications
- Discussions on radar sensing and pose estimation challenges

### 👨🏻‍💻 Technologies & Tools

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- MATLAB, C++
- OpenCV, scikit-learn

**Specializations:**
- Radar Signal Processing
- Computer Vision & Deep Learning
- Time-Series Analysis
- Sensor Fusion Algorithms

### ⚡ Beyond Research

When I'm not training models or analyzing radar data, you'll find me:
- 🎮 Gaming - Always up for a good strategy or RPG game
- 🎤 Singing - Music is my creative outlet

### 📫 Get in Touch!

I'm always happy to discuss research ideas, potential collaborations, or just chat about AI and radar sensing!
